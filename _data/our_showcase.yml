intro: |-
  Before diving further you should have a look at the [Base Case](../simulations/base_case). 
  
  Sensitivities are carried out by changing some parameters of the Base Case and analysing how the optimal energy system is modified. In order to analyse the impact of a single parameter, simulations are carried out with several values of that parameter to detect when changes take place, e.g. production and conversion capacity, load factor of conversion facilities, import flows… Here is an overview of the different scenarios considered together with a short overview.

  - title: High Renewable
    subtitle: Belgian system with a potential of 103.3 GW of solar PV, 20.5 GW of onshore wind and 9.3 GW of offshore wind
    description: |-
      The potential of solar PV, onshore and offshore wind is increased in order to test how much variable renewable energy sources could be integrated into the optimal Belgian energy system. The full potential of onshore wind (9.3 GW) and offshore wind (20.5 GW) is deployed, but not the full potential of solar PV, as in the Base Case. Consequently more hydrogen is produced from offshore wind and less gas is used to produce electricity. Most hydrogen remains imported because green electricity is preferably used directly for final electricity demand.

  - title: "Farther Offshore Wind : 40 to 1000 km"
    subtitle: Belgian system with offshore wind located 1000 km from the shore
    description: |-
      The average distance of offshore wind farms to the coast is artificially increased to detect when it is more interesting to produce hydrogen offshore rather than bringing electricity. As transporting hydrogen is cheaper than transporting electricity, with the distance increasing, the hydrogen production offshore also increases until it becomes more expensive than hydrogen imports from the COASTAL cluster.

  - title: "CO<sub>2</sub> Budget : 0 to 20% of 1990 CO<sub>2</sub> emissions"
    subtitle: Belgian system with a carbon budget of 20% of most of 1990 CO<sub>2</sub> emissions
    description: |-
      The Base Case assumes a net-zero energy system by 2050. But the Belgian energy system is integrated within the European energy market and the decarbonisation cost may be different across neighbouring countries. Therefore, some countries may have net-positive emissions, while other countries have net-negative emissions, in an optimal EU-wide energy system that still achieves net-zero emissions. If some CO<sub>2</sub> emissions are allowed for Belgium in 2050, the optimal energy system in Belgium is cheaper and less CO<sub>2</sub> is captured and exported.

  - title: "H<sub>2</sub> Import Cost : €75 to 300/MWh"
    subtitle: Belgian system with a higher H<sub>2</sub> import cost of €300/MWh
    description: |-
      Hydrogen can be produced in Belgium by electrolysis (green hydrogen) or using Steam Methane Reforming (SMR), or imported. There is a trade-off between imports and domestic production, depending on the respective prices. If the H<sub>2</sub> import cost increases, more H<sub>2</sub> is produced in Belgium, but the limited renewable electricity potential and the CO<sub>2</sub> export constraint restrict the production green electricity and force the hydrogen system to be balanced with blue hydrogen production from SMRs and green methane imports. This increases the need for carbon capture capacity and CO<sub>2</sub> exports.

  - title: "CO<sub>2</sub> Export Capacity : 3.5 down to 0 kt/h"
    subtitle: Belgian system with a CO<sub>2</sub> export capacity of 0 kt/h
    description: |-
      The capacity to export CO<sub>2</sub> by pipeline strongly impacts the ability to use methane in Belgium’s net-zero energy system in 2050. When the CO<sub>2</sub> export capacity decreases, less CO<sub>2</sub> emissions is allowed, so that CCGTs are less used and more electricity is imported. In the extreme case shown above, no CO<sub>2</sub> can be exported, CCGTs are seldom used and the captured CO<sub>2</sub> is even used in methanation facilities to produced CH<sub>4</sub> needed for final demand.
